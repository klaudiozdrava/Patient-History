# Patient-History
A ASP.NET web application that was developed as a university assignment regarding the registration and updating of patients' medical history.
At the same time, through the basic UML diagrams, the process of defining requirements, designing and developing the corresponding software was documented.
Also, the development of the four phases of the object-oriented software development model (Rational Unified Process) was implemented using its 9 diagrams.
These phases are the following:
• Inception
• Elaboration
• Construction of the software
